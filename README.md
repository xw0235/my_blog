#This is my personal blog project   
Today I create a new project to build my personal blog.I'll record the whole process of building my personal blog in this markdown file.
```bash
# to active the virtualenv
source env/bin/active
# cerate a Django project
django-admin startproject my_blog
# cd to the dir of 'my_blog'
cd my_blog
# cerate a app
./manage startapp blogApp
```
OK,now I'll open my VSCode to edit my code.
